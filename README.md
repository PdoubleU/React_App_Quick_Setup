This quick setup is ready to use instead of create react app.

> 1. removed default files
> 2. added basic folders structure for further developing
> 3. installed useful plugins: husky, eslint, prettier
> 4. set up husky to run before commit (test app and prettier the code), to make sure all tests passed before pushing on remote repo. 

This template might be developed and changed. It is based on create react app, so all functionality can be used here.
